# Testing of `lib/`

## TODO (tests to do):

 * Data *is* in the leaves, and can be succesfully inserted and retrieved
 * RBLdelete

## Notes
Testing is still in development. Really, `rbltree_test` should be split into
a complete testing-framework/module and the actual tests for `rbltree`.

Testing of `rbtree` should also be done.
