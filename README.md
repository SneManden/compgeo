# Computational Geometry Algorithm Implementations
Implementations of algorithms introduced and/or related to the course
"Computational Geometry" attended in the fall semester 2015 at SDU, Denmark.

[SDL](http://www.libsdl.org) is used for visualizations.

## Topics

 - Convex hull
 - Line Segment Intersection

### Datastructures

 - Circular linked list (from open source BSD library [queue.h](http://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/queue.3.html))
 - Red Black (Balanced) Search Trees (pseudocode from [Cormen])
 - Leaf-Oriented Balanced Search Trees (based on the red-black tree implementation)

## Note
The structure of this project still undergoes development. In particular,
tests are not properly done yet, as well as the compilation-workflow.
